Stress check...
ØFn = Ø * 0.85 * fc where Ø = 075
Maximum Compressive Stress for an element = 1.6831 MPa
ØFn = 12.75 MPa
Fu = 1.6831 MPa
ØFn => Fu
Compressive stress is within limits. Design can be conducted.

Vertical Reinforcement Design
Use 4 Ø12/200 mm
(p_v = 0.00452389 > 0.0025  -> OK ✔

Horizontal Reinforcement Design
Use 4 Ø12/200 mm
(p_v = 0.00452389 > 0.0025  -> OK ✔
