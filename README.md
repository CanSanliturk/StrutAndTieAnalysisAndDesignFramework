# StrutAndTieAnalysisAndDesignFramework
Framework that can be used to analyze 2-Dimensional concrete elements by using finite elements method and do strut and tie design according to ACI.

Finite element analysis engine is validated (by me, i would not recommend you to trust). 
Design algorithm is being developed. Even after it finished, DO NOT USE IT FOR REAL PROJECTS (like any one would have used...)
